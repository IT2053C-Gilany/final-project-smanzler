    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this dataset because I enjoy watching competitive Rocket League and wanted to see what I could find out from a dataset I could find.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "> This could include questions such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between X and Y variables?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of the variables?\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between the variables and the target?\n",
    ">   You will need to frame these questions in a way to show value to a stakeholder (i.e.why should we know about the relationship between X and Y variables?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What factors most strongly influence a team's chances of winning?  \n",
    "  For example, is boost usage, average speed, or time spent in various field zones correlated with match outcomes? Understanding these can help teams optimize their strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do individual player stats (e.g., shots, goals, saves) distribute across the league?  \n",
    "  Knowing the typical range and distribution of these key performance indicators can help benchmark player performance and set realistic training targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there notable differences in play style or performance between regions or teams?  \n",
    "  Comparing metrics like average boost usage or defensive time by region can highlight competitive advantages and inform transfer or recruitment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What player or team characteristics are associated with high goal participation or MVP status?  \n",
    "  Identifying these characteristics could help in talent scouting or developing players for key roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a relationship between match duration, overtime frequency, and total goals scored or player fatigue indicators?  \n",
    "  This could provide insights for scheduling and managing player workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering these questions will add practical value by helping stakeholders understand which in-game behaviors and stats drive successful outcomes and where to focus training or scouting efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
    "> Think about what those visualization could be: what are the variables used in the charts? what insights do you hope to gain from them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Visualizations Planned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Distribution of Core Player Stats:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Visualization: Histograms or boxplots of shots, goals, and saves per player.\n",
    "    - Variables: core_shots, core_goals, core_saves (from matches_by_players).\n",
    "    - Insight: Identify typical performance ranges and spot outliers or standout performers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Correlation Heatmap of Team Metrics and Winning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Visualization: Correlation matrix heatmap.\n",
    "    - Variables: Various team-level stats (e.g., boost_avg_amount, core_shots, movement_avg_speed, positioning_time_offensive_third) plus winner (from matches_by_teams).\n",
    "    - Insight: See which features most strongly correlate with winning to help teams focus training efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Regional Comparison of Play Styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Visualization: Grouped bar chart comparing average boost usage and time in field zones by region.\n",
    "    - Variables: team_region, boost_bpm, movement_time_supersonic_speed, positioning_time_offensive_third (from matches_by_teams).\n",
    "    - Insight: Discover stylistic differences between regions that might indicate unique strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Goal Participation by Player Position and Role:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Visualization: Strip plot or violin plot of goal participation versus average positioning.\n",
    "    - Variables: advanced_goal_participation, positioning_avg_distance_to_ball, positioning_time_most_forward (from matches_by_players).\n",
    "    - Insight: Analyze if certain player roles are more involved in goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Relationship Between Match Duration, Overtime, and Total Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Visualization: Scatter plot with regression line.\n",
    "    - Variables: match duration, overtime frequency, total goals (aggregated from matches_by_teams).\n",
    "    - Insight: Determine if longer or overtime-heavy matches have more goals, which can affect player fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Interactive Plotly Dashboard:\n",
    "    - Visualization: Interactive filterable chart (e.g., team or player stat comparison across regions or over time).\n",
    "    - Variables: User-selectable, but could include goals, assists, saves, or advanced_rating (from matches_by_players and teams, joined with region info).\n",
    "    - Insight: Allow stakeholders to explore comparisons tailored to their interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations are designed to extract actionable insights regarding player performance, team strategies, regional trends, and key drivers for match outcomes.\n"
